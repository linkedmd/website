# Linked Markdown

A Linked Markdown document has two sections:

- A first section with definitions, both local and remotely imported ones.
- A second section with its content, in Markdown.

## Uses

The main intended use is writing legal agreements and law. Linked Markdown provides powerful features for such a use case, because it allows to:

- Import data and definitions from other documents, reducing the need to repeat a definition and the risk of omitting it, which in turn increases precision of language
- Quickly create sound agreements by importing existing definitions from other documents. An open-source approach to law
- Clearly define data at the beginning of a document, avoiding subjective definitions and loose ends
- Reference such data in the document and know at a glance the value of the references
